	<a>The excitement I had when I reserved my Model 3 in 2016, and the love I had for it when I finally received it in October 2018 was crushed when a valet driver reversed it into wall in November 2018 causing significant structural damage. The car sat in a Tesla-certified body shop for 6.5 months due to parts delay from Tesla, during which time I exhausted every avenue available to me to get updates, general information, and overall support from Tesla.

Upon receiving the car I had to take it back in due to the safety module needing to be replaced. 

Due to my fear of what the diminished value of my car had now become, I sought assistance from Tesla, at which time I was notified that Teslaâ€™s dont have DV as they get repaired to a new state. 

In preparation for this Cybertruck (my hope to put this car in the past), I took my Model 3 into the service center due to their being continual issue with the safety module rendering my autopilot unusable for the past 13 months. I asked them to give me a trade-in value for use with this Cybertruck, and I was given a value that showed significant losses due to the DV. 

The massively disappointing experience I have had with the manufacturer that I convinced many of my peers to buy, has convinced me to never buy a Tesla, and to never recommend it to anyone since the support is terrible. 

I independently paid $800 to have an independent arbitraror calculate the DV of the car and the average loss from 5 luxury dealership in the Greater Seattle Area was 41%. Of which I was able to claim $0 with my insurance due to the lack of Tesla.

Embarassed to have held such high hope for Tesla.<a>
